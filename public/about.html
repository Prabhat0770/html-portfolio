<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for teaching mathematics. There’s something incredibly fulfilling about simplifying complex concepts and helping others see the beauty and logic behind numbers. Whether its solving equations or exploring mathematical theories, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and inspiring others to develop a love for the subject. Teaching has not only strengthened my own understanding but has also allowed me to connect with people and make a positive impact.</p>

<p>When I am not studying or teaching, you will likely find me exploring my other great passion—food! I am a self-proclaimed food enthusiast who loves trying out new cuisines and flavors. From street food to gourmet dishes, I believe food is a universal language that brings people together. Balancing my academic rigor with my hobbies keeps me grounded and motivated, and I am always excited to learn, share, and savor every moment of this journey!</p>
